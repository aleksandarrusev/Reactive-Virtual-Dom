# Reactive-Virtual-Dom
This is a tiny UI library inspired partly by Vue.js core functionality. 
The ReactiveVDom uses data-driven approach and separates the actual state from the UI. Instead of manipulating the dom elements directly, it uses a Virtual DOM, which on each data change transforms the real DOM.
